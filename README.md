NFT Events is a collection of unique events. Each NFT Tag is a gift from the organizer for the participant, which confirms the information about attending the event. Each time you participate in an event, NFT Events send a unique Tag, which is verified by a cryptographic record. These Tags are Non-Fungible Tokens and contain all information about the event.
