# NFT TON Events
NFT TON Events is a collection of unique events on The Open Network. Each NFT is a gift from the organizer for the participant, which confirms the information about attending the event. Each time you participate in an event, TON Events send a unique NFT, which is verified by a cryptographic record. These NFT are Non-Fungible Tokens and contain all information about the event.
